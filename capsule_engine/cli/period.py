"""``--period week|month`` sugar over ``--since``/``--until`` (design §10.2:
"the ledger scan already takes since/until (ISO-8601) ... Add --period
week|month as sugar over since/until").

This lives here, in capsule-engine, rather than in the shared
``capsule_ledger.cli.ledger_io``/``capsule_ledger.io`` scan-query plumbing
those flags actually come from -- because ``capsule-ledger`` was archived
(read-only) on GitHub on 2026-09-02 while this task was in flight (see the
``ledger`` lane outbox, ``[ldg-bj-folds-reduce-over-judgments]``). Each
ledger-backed verb that wants ``--period`` adds this module's argument and
calls :func:`apply_period` before building its ``ScanQuery``; once the
shared io module has a live home again, this belongs there instead, not
duplicated per verb.
